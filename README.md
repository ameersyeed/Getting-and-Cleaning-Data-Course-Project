About the script :

# Downloading and unzipping dataset

# Read in the data from files

# Assign column names to the data imported above

# Merging all data in one set

# Create a vector for the column names from the final data which will be used to select the desired mean() & stddev() columns

# Making necessary subset from merge_all

# Merging the tidyData with activityType to include descriptive activity names

# Making second tidy data set

# Export the tidyData set
